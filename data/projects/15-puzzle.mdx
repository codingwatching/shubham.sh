15 puzzle is a sliding puzzle having 15 square tiles numbered 1â€“15 in a frame that is 4 tiles 
high and 4 tiles wide, leaving one unoccupied tile position. It is a game designed for one 
player. Try to place the numbers on tiles in order using the empty space. You can slide 
four adjacent (left, right, above and below) tiles into the empty space. It's not as easy as 
you think. Challenge your mind!
